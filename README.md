#Psi Spell Library

A rather basic program for managing [Psi](http://psi.vazkii.us) spells, written for [/r/psispellcompendium](https://reddit.com/r/psispellcompendium).

Written in C#, using [fNbt](https://github.com/) for internal stuff.

Spells are stored in your "My Documents" (or equivalent), in "Psi Spell Library"

Once I get reliable Internet, I will be adding support for loading spells from /r/psispellcompendium.
This may take a while.

I know it sucks, if anyone can tell me any of the many things I'm doing wrong, please do.
